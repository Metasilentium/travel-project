            <p>
              Salem is known for its rich maritime history, as being the
              birthplace of the National Guard, and for the infamous Witchcraft
              Trials of 1692. Salem is also a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly City
              where its residents, and over a million tourists annually, can
              easily visit historic architecture, unique attractions,
              world-famous museums, and an eclectic mix of shops and dining
              options. And, with easy access to public transportation -
              including our own ferry - Salem is a great city to live, work,
              study, and play. Come discover all that Salem has to offer!
